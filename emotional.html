					<h1>Emotional Design</h1>
					<p> I drew an iteration sequence of how my prototype works. 
						The main idea was two friends talking about how the cant get a proper mirror selfie.
						‘X’ gets an idea & introduces the prototype ‘Capture Mi’. <br></br>
						The color that I used in my storyboard is yellow as it helps to convey my emotion which is happiness that the user gets after using this product.
						Firstly, I thought about the emotional design hierarchy; whether my product was pleasurable, useable, reliable and functional. Heuristic #7: Flexibility & Efficiency was also tested to make sure the product is functional and reliable and Heuristic #8: Aesthetics and minimalism was designed in a way that’s pleasurable to use for every user.<br></br>
						I filmed the iteraction sequence in my storyboard to show how the product works. My roommate Lilly was sweet enough to star in the video while my other roommate Nancy filmed it. I used adobe premiere pro to edit the video and add transitions and effects.
