					<h1> Portfolio Website</h1>
					<p> I designed and built an interactice portfolio website using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
						I hosted this webpage on GitHub.	<br></br>
						Initially I faced a lot of issues that required me to spend days debugging the problems but as I progressed
						I realised how much I learnt since high-school and how I can apply those lessons in different ways.<br></br>
						I am not from a CS background but once I set my mind to this I knew I couldn't give up until it was complete.
						Creating this website was a personal achievement since it took me days of trial and error, tutorials effects
						only to find out that creating a website isnt as hard as I thought it would be!<br></br>
						This website has different features such as; a downloadable resume, gives people a little more idea about who I am, 
						showcases my skills and projects as well as how to contact me.<br></br>
