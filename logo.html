					<h1>Logo Design</h1>
					<p> My second project was to design a logo for a client. 
						The colour palette I went for was warm muted colours; mainly red, grey and black. 
						This decision was taken due to the clientâ€™s love of Japanese, anime and mystery. 
						The Japanese letters in the backdrop symbolise his love for anime while the black and grey colour theme and typography shows his love for dark gaming; mainly Valorant.
						I also designed a few monograms so that he has a variety of options to choose from while creating his brand identity.
						When designing the presentation board, I kept in mind the hierarchy so that the main headings have a bigger font size while the subheadings have a smaller font.
