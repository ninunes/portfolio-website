                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Introvert, but loud when needed. That is a line that defines me. 
                    Hi! My name is Natasha Irene <br> Nunes and I come from the beautiful country of Oman. 
                    Even though I am an Indian by nationality, <br> I have spent the last 18 years of my life in Oman before moving to Canada. </br>
                    <br>I am a Second year Global Business and Digital Arts student at the University of Waterloo.</br>
                    I am interested in a lot of things such as music, dance, photography, art and digital marketing but <br>
                    the thing I love the most is fashion. </br>
                    <br>Fashion is an art form that allows you to express yourself and your views on a lot of issues. </br>
                    I remember wearing different outfits, jewelry and shoes to school and not repeating my outfits more <br> than twice a month. Now that I have grown, 
                    I realize how much waste it produces and in turn how <br>much harm it causes to the environment. 
                    I believe fast fashion is one of the main causes of <br> environmental  degradation and hence have decided to shop sustainably from thrift stores etc. </br>
                    <br> I am interested in working in the following fields; social media management, public relations, digital <br> marketing or CSR management in a fashion company. </br>
