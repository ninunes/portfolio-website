                <h1>Poster Design</h1>
                <p> My first project was to design a poster. I tried to design a basic poster that shows my story,
                    where I come from and what I value. I tried to show both parts of my life in this poster. <br></br>
                    The poster on the left is a picture of a beach is Oman which is where I was born and lived for the past 18 years. 
                    The poster on the right shows some on the pictures I clicked when I visited Lake Ontario with my roommate.
                    The illustration I made was my first effort at digital art. 
                    The whole mood of the poster is summer vibes which shows the beach during the day and before senset. 
                    It also shows peoples happiness when they get "Insta worthy" pictures to post after they have had a fun time at the beach! <br></br>
                    The Gestalt theory is a theory about perception. It states that "the whole is more than the sum of its parts."
                    It describes our ability to recognize patterns and make associations. I used the
                    GESTALT principles of symmetry, continuity and closure.
